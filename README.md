# Horiseon Refactor

## Description
This project involves refactoring both the HTML and CSS on the given UI landing page which is designed for desktop viewing. The HTML now contains semantic HTML labeling and groupings of similar code  will be created through the use of classes which makes CSS styling easier. Initial links in the navigation bar will now connect to content sections.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines.
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
